<h2>WEB</h2>
<p>
The World Wide Web (WWW), commonly known as the Web, is an information system
where documents and other web resources are identified by Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs, such as https://example.com/), which may be interlinked by
hyperlinks, and are accessible over the Internet. The resources of the
Web are transferred via the Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), may be accessed
 by users by a software application called a web browser, and are published by
 a software application called a web server. The World Wide Web is not
 synonymous with the Internet, which pre-dated the Web in some form by over two
  decades and upon the technologies of which the Web is built.

<h2>Artemisia Gentileschi
<br>아르테미시아 젠틸레스키는 누구인가</h2>
<p style="margin-top:40px;">
Artemisia Lomi or Artemisia Gentileschi was an <strong>Italian Baroque
  painter</strong>. Gentileschi is considered among the most accomplished
  seventeenth-century artists, initially working in the style of Caravaggio.
  She was producing professional work by the age of fifteen.
<p style="margin-top:20px;">In an era when women had few opportunities to pursue
  artistic training or
  work as professional artists, Gentileschi was the first woman to become a
  member of the Accademia di Arte del Disegno in Florence and she had an
  international clientele.
